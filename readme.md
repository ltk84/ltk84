## More about me üêß
I am particularly interested in aesthetics. That's why I'm focusing on **user interface** design and development. And with it, is the field of **user experience**, which is indispensable. I have the ability to design, evaluate, and develop user interfaces so that the product can be truly aesthetic as well as meet the requirements from analysis, design, and evaluation.

Besides that, I'm also learning **human resource development** and **project management**. This can be my main focus in the future.

# üéØ Main Focus
